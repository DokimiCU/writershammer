# WRITER'S HAMMER

A detailed story prompt generator.

Intended for writing short stories, as a fun writing practice.

Overcome writer's block by having the machine randomly generate all the basic elements needed for a good story (e.g. plot, characters, scenes). You can then focus on writing this story, without getting stuck at the  "I-don't-know-what-to-write-about" stage. Then when your story then goes horribly wrong you can blame the computer. 




### INSTALLATION
Requires python 3.6 to run.

This is not a stand alone application. 


### HOW TO USE

1. Open writershammer_main in the Python 3.6 IDLE.

2. Run the module

3. Input the key indicated for the generator you want to use. Do it as many times as you like to get an output you like.

(You can also run it via command line. e.g. C:\Users\MyName>python c:/BlaBlaBla/writershammer/writershammer_main.py)


### GENERATORS:

- Story, Genre, & Style: basic parts of a story. e.g. theme, pov, style.
- Setting: Where the story or a scene takes place.
- Character: goals and personality for a person.
- Scene: the actions that happen in a single scene.
- Solarpunk elements: a genre specific generator for Solarpunk.
- Famous phrases: start and end lines you can adapt, to help remind you what good writing looks like.





### TIPS:

- A full story will need: "Story, Genre, & Style" + at least one "Setting" + at least one "Character" + at least one "Scene".  
- The output is complicated. Spend some time deciding what the output means before jumping into your story.
- The generators come up with more than you need. Don't worry about trying to fit everything in. Just have fun.
- Let yourself be challenged. Random output will stretch you to try new things. Go with it!
- You final story probably wont resemble the random output much. That's okay. Output is there to inspire, not constrain.




### DEVELOPMENT:

I made this as a fun little tool for my own use. I have no plans to develop this into anything more sophisticated. It's a bit rough and incomplete, but it works.

Writer's Hammer is a very simple script. Anyone with amateur coding skills will be able to customize and expand this to their liking. Go for it!

If you make substantial improvements to this code please share the love and make it publicly available.


### FILES

`writershammer_main.py`: this is the main code that runs everything else.

`[NAME]gen.py`: these are the random generators. They mostly select random output from lists and return it in a readable form. Creating new generators is easy.

`[NAME]gen_lists.py`: these are the lists of possible output. Edit these lists if you want more possibilities.
